 artifact_crack_tech_nanite_repair_system_desc:0 "Our researchers during the recent archaeological excavations and the observation of ancient battlefields have discovered a means by which a Lost civilization has developed and applied nanites for military applications. By combining nanites with the tissue of regenerative hulls, we can gain access to much more powerful hull regenerative modules.

One of the chief physics researchers published a buzz-pushing papers in the local media three days, which he described as living in some kind of way and put together improbable strange evidence in an incredibly angle.
