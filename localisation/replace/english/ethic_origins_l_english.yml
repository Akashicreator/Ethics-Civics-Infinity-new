Forces sent to [captial_leader.GetName] are now moving closer to [from_overlord.GetCaptialName] as they move out of the [overlord_leader.GetName]'s original flag - a figure who has now appeared as a puppet of them, attempting to encircle the alliance's capital in an attempt to force the emergency council to fall. However, the emergency council has managed to salvage the alliance's actions as a socialistic ally, and as the first one to do so, we have officially taken over the command of forces in the capital and temporary leadership of the entire new federation.\n\nThe battle to decide that all our works have been lost for decades has already been played, this is the last struggle!"

The Emergency Committee has disbanded, along with the [from_overlord.GetSpeciesAdj] Socialist Republic Alliance, as a result of which the [from_overlord.GetSpeciesAdj] leadership proved their failure. Although this was not the best conclusion, the wave of nationalism in the alliance's constituent republics could not be halted overnight. After discussion, we, allies, and various newly formed socialist nations have decided to form a new socialist federation based on respect for the sovereignty of the new nation and adhering to socialism. Since the [from_overlord.GetSpeciesAdj] leadership has proven their failure, we, the [root.GetName], as the leader of the alliance to save the socialistism, have been chosen as the leader of the federation."
