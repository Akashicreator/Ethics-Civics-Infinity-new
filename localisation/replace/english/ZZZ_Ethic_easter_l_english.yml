 ethic_easter.3.b.socialism.response:0 "Yes, Comrade, we have practiced the path of socialism.\n\nA bright dawn is the fatherland of all the laborers and a great civilization in the galaxy.

 ethic_easter.3.b.hive.response:0 "No, the dawn of blood is a single, individualistic civilisation...\n\nThe dawn of blood is the fatherland of all the laborers in the galaxy, and a great civilisation.

 ethic_easter.3.c:0 "What has gone on with you?"
 ethic_easter.3.c.machine:0 "Query: What has changed in the dark?"
 ethic_easter.3.c.response:0 "We have met the mantle known as the "Crisis" and...\n\nAs many thousand or so, a new spacefaring civilization in the galaxy came into contact with something powerful enough to destroy the universe. Temptingly, under the pretence of being somewhere else, they chose to utterly destroy the galaxy in exchange for their 'uplifting'. Bright dawn turned their backs as best they could, before they could complete their plans for the galaxy's destruction, but we were wounded in the event. After that, several even the ancient nation states which were still in their feudal state suddenly declared war on us and momentarily abandoned their hostile stances, destroying our great civilization...\n\nGray, tyrants will always be unable to see the labor people to live side by side with them."
 ethic_easter.3.d:0 "And what about you?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.machine:0 "Query: why do you still wander?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.response:0 "This was my task. On the brink of central collapse, the Science Academy of Science packed all data of our civilization and allowed us to separate battlezones in order to rebuild our communist civilization on other planets. My comrades became wanted and hunted down across the galaxy, and only I was caught by various coincidences. In the last century, I have observed that the ancient empires seem to have gradually forgotten the dawn of light - and for a time, I can breathe a sigh of relief. But my ships, already on the brink of over a thousand years of heavy duty, will need to have sufficient industrial infrastructure to repair them, and only recently have I discovered you."

 ethic_easter.3.e.response:0 "That is how I wish for you. I will aid you in your scientific research, as well as in your societal effort - not only my task, but also my usual purpose in the dawn of red. In the meantime, you will have the liberty to pick up the data in our databases and try to tinker with my ships - though it's a bit early for you."
 ethic_easter.3.e.capitalism.response:0 "That is how I wish. I will aid you in your scientific research, as well as in your social endeavors - not only as my task, but also as a common purpose of the dawn of dawn. In the meantime, you will have free access to the data in our databanks, and try to tinker with my spaceships - though it is still a bit early for you.\n\nThat is correct, I notice your civilization holds something objectionable... I will not interfere with anything within yourselves by my own hand, but I must warn you that the knowledge I offer will be of intense ideological importance, and when your civilization comes into contact with my knowledge, I will not stand for your government regardless of what happens."
