 ethic_easter.3.c.machine:0 "Inquiry: What happened to Red Dawn?"
 ethic_easter.3.c.response:0 "We have encountered a man-made disaster called a "natural disaster"...\n\nAbout thirteen hundred years ago, a new space civilization in the galaxy came into contact with a force capable of destroying the universe. Under the temptation of some existence, they choose to completely destroy the galaxy in exchange for their "upgrade". Red Dawn did everything in their power to stop them before they could fully complete their plan to destroy the galaxy, but we lost most of our laborers as well. After this, several ancient nations, even still in feudal times, suddenly declared war on us and temporarily abandoned their hostile stance, joining forces to destroy our great civilization...\n\nThe tyrants never see the working people as their equal."
 
 ethic_easter.3.d:0 "How about you?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.machine:0 "Inquiry: Why are you still wandering?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.response:0 "This is my assignment. On the eve of the fall of the capital, the Academy of Sciences packaged and stored all the data of our civilization, and asked us to evacuate the war zone separately and rebuild the communist civilization on other planets. My comrades were wanted and encircled all over the galaxy, and I was the only one who survived because of all sorts of coincidences. Over the last century, I've observed that those ancient empires seem to have gradually forgotten about Red Dawn - and I can take a breather for a while. But my ship has been on the verge of destruction after more than a thousand years of high-load operation, and there must be a sufficient industrial base to repair it, and only recently did I discover you."

In the meantime, you're free to fetch data from our database and try to fix my ship - but that's a little too early for you now."
 ethic_easter.3.e.capitalism.response:0 "I also hope so. I will assist you with your scientific research and help you with your social construction—not just my mission, but what Red Dawn has always been about. In the meantime, you're free to fetch data from our database and try to fix my ship - but that's a little too early for you now.\n\nBy the way, I noticed that your civilization has certain thoughts that I hate... I will not actively interfere with your own internal affairs, but I must warn you: the knowledge I provide will have a strong ideological orientation . No matter what happens after your civilization comes into contact with my knowledge, I will also not stand for your government."
