 ethic_easter.3.c:0 "What have you encountered?"
 ethic_easter.3.c.machine:0 "Inquiry: What happened to Red Dawn?"
 ethic_easter.3.c.response:0 "We have encountered a man-made disaster called a "natural disaster"...\n\nAbout 36,000 years ago, a new space civilization in the galaxy came into contact with some kind of force capable of destroying the universe. Under the temptation of certain existences, they choose to completely destroy the galaxy in exchange for their own "upgrade". Red Dawn did everything in his power to stop them before they could complete their plan to destroy the galaxy, but we were also greatly damaged by it. After this, several ancient countries, even still in feudal times, suddenly declared war on us, temporarily abandoned their hostile positions and joined forces to destroy our great civilization ...\n\nThe tyrants never see the working people as their equal."
 
 ethic_easter.3.d:0 "How about you?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.machine:0 "Inquiry: Why are you still wandering?"
 ethic_easter.3.d.response:0 "This is my task. On the eve of the fall of the Central, the Academy of Sciences packed and stored all the data of our civilization and asked us to evacuate the warring zones separately and rebuild communist civilization on other planets. My comrades were wanted and besieged throughout the galaxy, and only I survived by various coincidences. Over the last century, I've observed that the ancient empires seem to have forgotten the red dawn—and I can take a breather for a while. But my ship was on the verge of destruction after more than 20,000 years of heavy operation and had to be repaired with enough industrial base, and I didn't discover you until recently."

 ethic_easter.200.name:0 "Eternal Time and Space"
 ethic_easter.200.desc:0 "So, is that the so-called 'knowledge administrator' starting again?\n\nAh, yes, we have seen them since 50000 years ago. They are passionate about harvesting the spark of wisdom from every civilization in the Milky Way, and then preserving it in the stagnant position of their home planet to permanently freeze their thinking, earning the nickname "preserving knowledge for the Milky Way". Countless civilizations have fallen or even perished due to the lack of key technologies, and it was only when we were still at the red dawn that these insane creatures were willing to converge"
 ethic_easter.200.f:0 "In that case, let's not follow their instructions."

 ethic_easter.200.a:0 "We are too weak, maybe we really need to hand you over"
 ethic_easter.200.a.response:0 "Are they asking for me?\n\nIt's not impossible... Seriously, when I knew we were in contact with them, I was prepared to be kidnapped by this group of pariahs – and there were precedents for forcing certain countries to hand over their heads of state and forcing the Gestalt civilization to give away their brains."

 ethic_easter.200.b:0 "Will they target you because of your Red Dawn background?"
 ethic_easter.200.b.response:0 "Perhaps not, their technology is not yet strong enough to achieve universal immortality. It has been over 10000 years since the disappearance of our Red Dawn, and they have long forgotten all about it.\n\n*sotto voce*I even suspect that they don't even remember where their species' parent star is."

 ethic_easter.200.c:0 "You Are you really willing to go there? Go to your enemy's territory?"
 ethic_easter.200.c.response:0 "The life of an individual? We Red Dawn don't care about these. It is the parochialism of biological instinct to attach too much importance to the survival of individuals, while the sea of our collective unconscious completely covers this backward gene philosophy. We have been fighting for the progress of all civilizations since the appearance of the Red Dawn. Your civilization is still young and full of vitality, and losing an outsider will not harm the progress you deserve. Providing assistance for your growth is what we seniors should do."

 ethic_easter.200.d:0 "So... Goodbye, friend."
 ethic_easter.200.d.response:0 "Goodbye, friends, I wish you always progress.\n\nI have left the database at the Capital Academy of Sciences, and you can access it at any time through the communication list.\n\nDon't worry about me, even in a stagnant position, I won't die completely. The universe is big, but life is even bigger. As long as the spark remains, we will eventually reunite at the end of the universe, right?*smile*"
