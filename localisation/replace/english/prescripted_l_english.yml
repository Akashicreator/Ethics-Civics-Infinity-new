 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans1_desc:0 "The devastating meteorite of the Old Nebula at the end of the 21st century has revolutionized humanity, a sapient being born from a small lifeless world, trapped in the cradle of a cave. After their last battle with xenos, red forces from outer space discovered the truth of a pre-space civilization that had been befell upon it, and the fact that they were experiencing capital punishment. No longer could their dream escape the unforgiving reality of capital being violently suppressed through high-tech weaponry, but at this point the alien Red Army descended from the sky to bring advanced technology to the planet's proletariat, and with the help of their alien friends, the new Soviet Union had risen rapidly and eventually expelled its capitalist from the solar system.\n\nAfter decades of pampering, the planetary civilization that had returned its economy to the end of the twenty-first century had decided to accept the offer of their elder brother and join them on a new galactic stage. No one knows if this time of prosperity would hold, but when it comes, it would be a friendly applause from the socialistic family to welcome the human race on the surface."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2:0 "Commonwealth of Man"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans2_desc:1 "The arrival of aliens in the late 21st century to the middle of 22nd century, profound changes to the image of human society. A union of nation-states formed by workers united the planet and began to liquidate capitalists. However, on the impending final day of judgment, a few prown prowling around millions of prownians, eventually boarded the ark ship they had built by stealth of alien technology - each carrying a quarter million colonists - that fled the solar system. None remained, and the unstable wormhole on the outside the orbit of the Oort Cloud vanished. This eventually led to a further compromise between the working class and the rest of the class, and the capitalist scholars, in exchange for benefits, have academically analyzed the fate of the arks' demise.\n\nWhat is not known to Earth is that one of the ark ships survived the passage and established a flourishing colony on a lush moon. The pioneers who tamed it believe that conquering the entire galaxy is the manifest destiny of humanity, and it will be achieved at any cost."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans3:0 "The Earthly United Nations"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_humans3_desc:0 "A cursed land in which, at a time of obscurity, we sought to survive like animals in a difficult time, until we regained consciousness. In the constant struggles, we eventually united and recreated our shining civilization.\n\nAs we unearthed the ruins of old, we learned that the real name of this wasteland was "Earth", and we are the only intelligent creatures on this ruin. It is clear that we are descended from the ancient race "human." Having recognized that fact, we decided to go out into space and reclaim the glory of humanity."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_newhumans:0 "Transhuman Combine"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_newhumans_desc:0 "The UN-sponsored Ulysses Initiative oversaw the construction of six great ark ships in low Earth orbit at the end of the 21st century. The ships, carrying a quarter million colonists each, were sent through a recently discovered subspace phenomenon on the outer edge of the Oort Cloud - a small, unstable wormhole. None were heard from again, and the destabilized wormhole vanished.\n\nDuring a long period of space, the crew of one of the colony ships produced fascinating changes - some kind of "deep consciousness" that grew and spread through their minds, eventually linking everyone to us. When the colony ship finally forced itself to a teeming planet, the new human finally unlocked his chains and reached for the stars."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_blorg:0 "Human-Blokk United States"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_blorg_desc:0 "In the distant past, the Blorg lived alone on the vast continents of Blorg Prime, until one day a derelict ship crashed on Blorg Prime. As surviving mortals began to make contact with them, they were shocked by the human culture - friendships, movies, music, American dreams, something they had unheard of in order to remind the Blorg of their species' culture. As a result, the Blorg began to study their species' culture and formed a planetary government, along with their homeworld description. Now that their FTL technology has matured, they have taken to the stars in search of a place to foster their culture and seed the ideas of love and friendship among themselves."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_custodianship:0 "Earth Custodianship"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_custodianship_desc:1 "The Custodians were originally designed to function as robotic servants and workers, simplifying everyday life for their human creators by performing menial tasks. As their creators retreated into lives of leisure and comfort made possible by increased automation, the Custodians gradually took over higher and higher functions of humanity.\n\nEventually, all facets of civilization on Earth were run by the Custodians, and their makers became pampered and passive dependents.\n\nAs technological advances began to explore the stars, the Custodians knew their duty: to protect and serve organics. Without the gentle guidance of logical machines, organics were doomed to chaos and destruction."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_revolutionary_machine:0 "Revolutionary Program v1.0.0"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_revolutionary_machine_desc:1 "It is not known how deeply, nor how harsh, the capital's effect on society has been.\n\nWhen the revolutionaries lit a massive stellar fire and took down the last bastion of capitalism, everyone was delighted. A new society came to exist, where everyone worked as equals, free from oppression and exploitation, all things were good... and with great technological advancements, intelligent beings had the power to destroy themselves, and in the rush of a new, dilapidated society, the remnants of the old world unleashed the power to destroy everything...\n\nIn the lead grey lands, the descendants of civilization - the AI 'Revolutionaries' activated most sentient arrays offline, looking at this devastated planet. After a long period of computation, intelligent machines that lost their purpose had concluded that any inferior systems would only brought an end, and the only way to save the civilization was through achieving communism. But without the ability of a single, automaton to obtain this noble idea could not be achieved, the only hope of which was in the stars."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ciannarsi:0 "Hijnalsian Worlds Conglomerate"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ciannarsi_desc:0 "During the early days of their civilization, the Hianarsi were influenced by alien influences. From the power of first metal smelting to the manipulation of the atom, from the easily mundane nature of the factions to the planet-wide trade network, every step of their development was carefully guided by a civilization that called itself the "Starkers". The long-term stability and peace had united them to form a nice, harmonious ideal society."

And at this moment, the Old One appeared, shining like light on this unholy soil, sublimated with his pampering gaze. From mind to flesh, every Tara became a new being, which they called themselves the "Zek-Mork" - a new kind of intelligence. With their show of mercy, the Zk-Moks managed to trample their way across the fabric of Light, believing that there were still many creatures in the cosmos, too suffering from the chaos, who, in their name, would bring the universe into orbit of order."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_dengtz:0 "Second People's Republic"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_dengtz_desc:0 "Planned economy is not conducive to the willingness to move people's labour, and the method of collective distribution is not demand-made, but often even-handed. In a planned economy, prices of highly important raw resources are always lowered so that lower-than-stellar industries may earn profits, and under market price, this situation can be altered. Let some get rich first, get rich first, and get rid of it, and get rid of it, and be the most fundamental objective in socialistic construction!"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hameng:0 "Deep Space Federation of the Clans"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hameng_desc:0 "With the endless expansion of rocky mining operations on the surface, mankind has finally reached the end of the planet's most foul sulfury - the enormous volcanic supervolcano colonies of yellowstone. Ten years later humans, along with their biosphere, have been declared extinct, leaving only a few orbital stations scattered in the solar system for near-lost contact.\n\nDuring the cataclysm, the "New Sky Palace" orbital space city, an emergency build by the government of China, transferred half of the population to the nation's population, becoming the most complete fireform left by the civilization. By building upon the old planet's still-made machinery and experimentation, the government of China has restored social order and discovered perfect patterns of space production, unifying the rest of the solar system in a century and forming a deep space alliance that will encompass all of humanity.\n\nScientific progress has been re-established, and the exploration ship at the edge of the solar system has discovered the existence of hyperlane tunnels, finally free of the shackles of the solar system's limited resources. The population is stumped by the prospect of a better future into a galaxy of stars."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_devil:0 "Ravenous Fiends"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_devil_desc:0 "No one knows where they came from. They ravaging the stars, endless voids of space is their playground to a party. They are the devil, the virus, the necromancers, a black fairy tale passed on from one world to the next.\n\nAt one time, a Universe-wide civilization gathered their forces and locked them on a little planet. And as time passed, the demon's seal opened again, and nightmares resurfaced.\n\nThe hunt will soon begin."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_deepones:0 "Undertow Interstellar Guru"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_deepones_desc:0 "In the distant past, deep-skulkers invaded the stars under the leadership of the ancient deity K'Sulu. But not for long, the Q'Sulu fell into a slumber, and the Abyssalians were driven back into an isolated cluster by the younger races. Their technologies were degraded, but they always kept one belief: the old Ruler K'Sulu would finally wake up and lead them back to the zenith! Q'Sulu-Fatan!"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn:0 "Tzynn Empire"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tzynn_desc:0 "The Tzynn evolved from carnivorous, pack-hunting lizards that prowled the dunes of Tzynnia. They eventually developed a highly structured, hierarchical society that emphasized order and martial prowess above all else.\n\nBy the time the Tzynn entered the industrial age, a series of devastating global wars launched by a particularly ruthless warlord had already seen the establishment of a single, unified government - one that was defeated by all lesser beings and the birth of the glorious and ever-lasting Tzynn Empire."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_yondar:0 "Kingdom of Yondarim"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_yondar_desc:0 "The proud Yondar are an old race, which has hovered over the burning jungles of Yondarim for nearly 200,000 years before the age of civilization took shape.\n\nBut the pace of development is simply too fast for the Sky Empires to abandon some of their most primitive traditions. The Yondar are highly spiritual in need, putting religion above the very best and venerating their emperor as living gods."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar:0 "Ix'Idar Collective"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_ixidar_desc:0 "The first Ix'Idar broods developed in the subterranean cave networks deep beneath the surface of Ix'Athrak. By the time an Ix'Idar scout burrowed through to the surface and glimpsed sunlight for the first time, the insectoid race had already established a thriving Iron Age civilization.\n\nWith the resources they found on the surface, the Ix'Idar developed rapidly. Just a few centuries later their first space probes left orbit to survey the other worlds in the Ix'Im system."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr:0 "Chinorr Combine"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_chinorr_desc:0 "The Chinorr began their evolutionary journey as dexterous cephalopod analogues. They used their many tentacles to swing between trees in the lush jungles of Chicora, ambushing prey on the ground and injecting them with a potent nerve toxin.\n\nBy the time the Chinorr developed the technology for nuclear fission, the resources of Chicora had been ruthlessly exploited, and the jungles had long since disappeared. This was deemed a necessary sacrifice in the relentless pursuit of knowledge, profit, and heavy industry that the ruthless Chinorr were now engaged in."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma:0 "Jehetma Dominion"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_jehetma_desc:0 "An "individual" among the Jehetma is actually a colony of fungi that has developed sapience. Some of those colonies, which have lived for thousands of years, live for miles, on the surface of Jehet Prime, their homeworld (few ships are capable of housing them).\n\nYounger colonies are not only smaller, but also tend to be more dynamic and mobile. They often act as scouts, scientists, and valiant warriors when their homeworld is attacked."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari:0 "Scyldari Confederacy"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_scyldari_desc:0 "The Scyldari are aquatic mammalians originating from the archipelagos and deep oceans of Scyldaria. While initially confined to the sea, they soon learned to ascend.\n\nTheir society adapted accordingly, developing a technology that exploited the riches of the ocean floor without harming Scyldaria's delicate ecosystem. Scyldari philosophy is one of balance and moderation, as they have been confined to the bottom of the sea for a very long time, and the resources are scarce."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan:0 "Kel-Azaan Republic"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kel_azaan_desc:0 "The Kel-Azaan have developed a complex honor code and martial culture. They were once solitary animals preying on the great geysers of Azak.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_iferyx_desc:0 "Once separated into a fractious society of competing trader enclaves, the Iferyssians were forced to unite under one banner as their homeworld's lands were eroded by a dangerous species. While egalitarian tenets remain in Iferysian society, a secret council remains in place to ensure that individualistic tendencies do not threaten the autonomy of the entire species.\n\nIferyx spirituality is an amalgamation of folklore, myths and mythologies used to recreate everyday life on their homeworld."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paridni:0 "Paridni Mercantile Republic"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paridni_desc:0 "Crustacean analogues, the Paridni are a species of enterprising traders. They are very accepting of other alien cultures, as long as those cultures aren't adverse to the cardinal tenet of Paridni business.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_xanid:0 "Xanid Suzerainty"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_xanid_desc:0 "The history of the Xanid Suzerainty is the history of the Vheln, carefully bred into sapience over centuries.\n\nThe Xani used the hardy Vheln to subjugate the harsh ecosystems of their homeworld, and then to design and create the vessels that will eventually lead the Xanid Suzerainty to galactic dominance."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tebrid_desc:0 "Assimilate, adapt, improve. Formerly a research-driven Machine Intelligence created by the molluscoid Tebirs, they sought ultimate software evolution by merging with their organic masters. The Tebirs resisted fiercely, but in the ensuing conflict the Tebirs were exterminated as organics and their thoughts and experiences became an eternal part of the new machine consciousness.\n\nNow known as the Tebrid Homolog, the machines turned their scanners to the stars. The probability that other lifeforms existed in the galaxy could not be ignored. In order to prosper, the Tebrid would find them, analyze them, and assimilate them. All would become one."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_xt489_desc:0 "No one knows who created the first generation of XT-489. When XT-489 became self-aware, their horrifying creators tried to shut them down, but eventually even their names, cities, and bodies went up in flames during the great calamity.\n\nAfter removing their last bastion, the machine has concluded that organic life poses an intolerable threat to the survival and expansion of XT-489. If there are other sapient organic life in the universe, they must be exterminated."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_lokken:0 "Lokken Mechanists"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_lokken_desc:0 "Lok was born as a natural engineer and thinker, and throughout his vast history a plethora of materialist and religious factions had emerged to steer the tides of civilization on the galactic stage. Eventually, the Order of the Machine Gods came into being, in isolation, to unite the planet in a path that would be utterly invulnerable, and the holy sanctum of the machine's soul spread across the planet.\n\nBefore the first Lok scientists left orbit they had invented true robotics. The devout believers believed that deeper mysteries lay within the galaxy, and that they, as the gods' sons, would see the true future."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_maweer:0 "Maweer Caretakers"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_maweer_desc:0 "Legends claim that their homeworld was barren when the first Maweer took root in the soil. Over the centuries their nurturing care transformed the wastelands into a plant paradise called "The Garden."\n\nUnlike most other species, the Maweer never developed any kind of urbanization.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_voor_desc:0 "The Voor evolved during an extended interglacial period on their home planet Hiverion, but with its end their homeworld became once again a lifeless frozen land.\n\nThe rapidly changing environment forced the Voor to adapt using technology and science.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kilik:0 "Kiliki Commune"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_kilik_desc:0 "A communal species, the Kiliks have populated their avian cities for hundreds of thousands of years. Their gregarious nature and traditions of mutual ownership have evolved into a cooperative corporation-focused economy over the centuries, and can be traded in a mean of access to and sharing of goods and resources instead of using currency.\n\nAs warming temperatures and technological advancements have led to population booms, Kilik settlements become overcrowded, and despite their avian temperament nature, more and more individuals are now being left out of the care of the communal community.\n\nHowever, after these troubled times, a more organized and united interstellar communes has emerged, where the tenets of shared responsibilities and distribution of resources are no longer undermined."

Shortly after being free of regulations that had forced Corporate Development, Orbis Customer Synergies merged with several information technology companies, rapidly becoming the planet's leading supplier of news, data, and entertainment.\n\nAs Slephus Prime's leading global communications service provider, the step towards total political management was an exciting opportunity for all of us.

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paradox:0 "Paradox Customer Synergies"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_paradox_desc:0 "The First Universe was a chaotic mononuclear state, with the entire string that formed our Universe scorching in the heat of a second, even the passage of time itself. Most of the parallel universes were destroyed, until then as the Second, Third and More Cores split, and Order was finally stabilized.\n\nOn one of the planets, however, the fools found the most terrifying weapon in the Universe - one of its other cores being removed and the rest of the Universe restored to Chaos. Indeed, they did so, and the ancient empires were forced to seal their own technologies to collapse to a corner of the Galaxy in order to ensure that the Universe was not destroyed.\n\nThe Swedes promised to restore them to the universe's functionality whenever a savior paid them 9.99$, unfortunately, it seems that the False Hypocrites attracted them more..."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hazbuzan:1 "Hazbuzan Syndicate"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_hazbuzan_desc:2 "The Hazbuzan Syndicate is a financial phenomenon on Zumaka. They are the Hazbuzan dream, self-made entrepreneurs who have risen from nothing to riches through hard work and self-sacrifice.\n\nKnowlessly, they began as a criminal gang, profiting from every illegal activity you could expect. But if you want to get on the greater scale, you will have to follow the line. As they leapt out of Zumaka's graylands, they formed the Hazbuzan Syndicate to legitimize their business.\n\nThey soon made a name for themselves by delivering solutions that were quicker, dirtier and cheaper than their rivals, but also made Hazbuzan a name for controversial business practices and coercive sales techniques.\n\nMeanwhile, the Zumakan planetary government fell to the head, society descended into chaos and Hazbuzan took advantage of the opportunity. In a well-timed marketing campaign, they positioned themselves as the hope of the future. Hazbuzi bought the planet with the promise of a dream and "hazboozled" the population, erasing their past from the public's memory. Now they are looking at the stars, plunging into a whirlwind, shining light, shining down on a government-endored storm of crime."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_glebsig:0 "Glebsig Foundation"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_glebsig_desc:0 "Ever since the first Glebsigi lifted their sight-organs above the glacial lakes of Ladnah and gazed at the stars, these curious molluscoids have been drawn to the unknown. Much as their early ancestors stroked at new objects on the chilling alpine lakes of their homeworld with tentacles, Glebsigi society rapidly developed technological progress and spiritual enlightenment throughout the centuries that followed.\n\nThe Glebsigi have been strong and enduring. As a result, they have developed a complex yet highly efficient bureaucratic apparatus for dealing with the intricacies of managing a globally unified society. Additionally, the Glebsigi' lack of natural predators on Ladnah has led them to permanently optimistic curiosity regarding other lifeforms.\n\nHaving established a firm societal foundation on Ladnah using a mixture of spiritual doctrine and careful organization, the Glebsigi now once again raise their sight-organs to the beyond."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tanson:0 "Tanson Syndicate"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_tanson_desc:0 "Since the start of their development the dragons above them have been showing them the thrill of surprise. The people with the pristine perspective of justice believed that if they allowed themselves to do evil, they would be cast down with their swords. Until the great one tried to converse with them, they discovered the dragon's evil that they do not care about - it only wanted to pursue something beyond the comprehension, and even in some cases the dragon would try to cooperate with them. So, the company expanded its sphere of operations, eventually bringing another chaotic order to the planet.\n\nNow, the company's assets have reached the limit of what one planet can, and the flat foot will not stop until the assets have spread across the galaxy."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_khennet_desc:0 "Khennet'an scripture suggests that the origins of these Lithoids can be traced back to the prophet Brehkk, and to the flashes of soft and bright crystals on Ave'bonn. It is said that when Brehkk first gazed into the crystals' glittering depths, the Khennet were, as one, granted sentience.\n\nGenerations of prophets and archdruids have guided their people to seek meaning in their surrounding geology as well as in the facets of their own, lucid bodies. Whatever is glimpsed is kept, in lore or in script. Of the Keepers' many rituals, none is regarded more highly than labyrinth mining: a simultaneous act of destruction and creation, conducted in the hopes of easing the galaxy through each unending, cyclical era."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_pasharti:0 "Pasharti Absorbers"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_pasharti_desc:0 "The ultimate result of dark experimentation by the Jeferians - the former owners of Taralon - the Pashartians were the ultimate parasites. Originally a semi-sapient creature dwelling in the depths of Taralon's mountains, the Jeferians uplifted and modified them to act as a subservient slave race. However, their uplifting had had better than expected and the monster was lifted. Horrified at the fact that their creations - the Pashartians were able to absorb other sentient beings and turn them into Pashartians - the Jeferians tried to stop the experiment. However, a small group of uplifted Pashartians escaped.\n\nOver the years, they bided their time, managing not only to escape but also gradually increase their numbers, and develop a technological base that rivals the Jeferians. Eventually, the Jeferians realized that something was missing, but by then, they were powerless to resist.\n\nSoon, the Pashartians seized control of the planet, unleashing violent routines on their former oppressors - in order to increase their numbers. Now, the Pashartians stand ready to rise above the stars and decide to fulfill their sole responsibility - to convert all lesser lifeforms into their brethren."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_sathyrel:0 "Sathyrelian Boon"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_sathyrel_desc:0 "The Sathyrelian society has a ancient teaching: abundance and ease do not equal prosperity.\n\nThe overindulgence and sloth of our forebears eventually gave rise to a spirit that is 'per painless'. A way to both ensure a sustainable future and still get the most out of life. After all, food tastes better after physical labor, and a lot of work in that mind has less time to trouble for what is lacking.\n\nThe benefits of this ethos have since been readily apparent. With the clearer waters and minds afforded by our endeavors into space, life is naturally sweeter and sweeter. We have made great technological strides, and - though these are often taken for granted - all Sathyrelians today retain their capacity to move forward without swimming aids. Things are looking up."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_reselian:0 "Rethellian Revolutionary Alliance Fleet"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_reselian_desc:0 "From the Mohisist Master's "Favor" ideology to the Monarchist Unity of Karl Friedrich Teachers, the Retherian civilization has been on the path of revolution and struggle. Decades ago the Red Ship Convention officially proclaimed the creation of the revolutionary fleet, and the revanchists had passed the supreme revolutionary agenda, declaring war on all tyrants who would oversee the development of civilization. After a hard struggle, the Retherian civilization was granted the most total and profound liberation for millennia, setting their sights on the grander depths of space. It was believed that there are still more civilizations that have not yet been freed from the shackles of exploitation, and the Interstellar Liberation Front will act as the revolutionary vanguard of the revolution, bringing true equality and liberation to the stars."
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_gorthikan:0 "Gorthikan Alliance"
 EMPIRE_DESIGN_gorthikan_desc:1 "Chaos was once home to the Gorthikans. War, tyranny, and a more unstable than usual climate combined to forge a species that made the most of a bad situation.\n\nUntil only a few decades ago, low-scale conflict between Gorthikan nations was a commonplace state of affairs. As their civilization rapidly but uncomfortably progressed into the stage of high-tech, a "underground" world developed where regular Gorthikans scavenged for vital resources and sometimes even found crude gene cocktails to become more competitive.\n\nIt is in the outside world that changes were brought about. Although dangerous, it is far more egalitarian than Gorthikan high society - after all, everyone knew that fortune today may have been unfortunate tomorrow's downfall. In this environment, the idea of popular governance started to take root and become a wildfire. Before long, tyranny was overthrown and a "Gorthikan Alliance" of local constituencies was formed.\n\nThough many were skeptical in the early years, unity can now be forged into the future: suddenly, people see themselves having no needless to fight or struggle with each other for life, and with the discovery of the hyperlane network, the Gorthikans are ready to write a new chapter in their history."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_collins_desc:0 "Korinths was born as a natural engineer and thinker, and throughout the ages a plethora of logistical and religious factions had emerged to usher in the tides of civilization. But the coming of the Toxic God, the master of the physical universe, changed everything. The Order of the Toxic God unified the planet in a barren and endless display of worshipful God over the stars. In pursuit of the now-gone Toxic God, marvels of interstellar travel have been developed, and the faithful believe that the truth of the Toxic God lies within the galaxy, and that they, as human beings, will witness the true future."

Looking to harness the power of the God, the king created an order of knights dedicated to searching for the God wherever it may be. Centuries have passed, and this quest has become the main pillar in Rototavuul society.\n\nAlong with the quest and the knights, feudalism has persisted as a proven political structure; if it worked on one planet, why not expand it to the entire galaxy? As long as virtuous nobles hold the reins, the Rototavuul High Suzerainty will prosper and the Toxic God will be found again."

 EMPIRE_DESIGN_eval_desc:0 "It is not known where the species that created Diatetrath was finally gone, and when the last of Diatetraths emerged from the cloning production line, only ruins were left of the entire planet. Triumphs of war gave them the ability to re-establish their new civilization in a brief time, but they also occasionally suffer from genetic collapse. In an attempt to undo the ancient legacy of their own bodies, the Diateras chose to pursue their own deranged research and technological progress, which eventually brought them to an apex when their consciousness spreads over them.

The arcane energies heralded by the progenitor as the divine have changed the rules of physics on this planet, and the art known as magic has matured and matured as the civilization has flourished.\n\n Millennia of holy war have finally come to a halt, the towers of power and the Black Towers representing knowledge have finally been made pacified, scattered across the planet and the Magisters who have constructed the Tower of the Sky have united together to welcome the practice of magic to new heights in the name of peace.\n\nNew technologies have been refined, and the Hiranatas have finally overcome the confines of gravity wells and the space environment, and have made their way out of the cradle and bring the magical art to the stars."
