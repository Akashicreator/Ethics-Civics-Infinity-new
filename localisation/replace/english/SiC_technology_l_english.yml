 tech_enigmatic_code_creation: "Celestial Machine Password"
 tech_enigmatic_code_creation_desc: "We will create a cipher system that will be unfathomable - one that may, of course, bring some windfall."
 tech_enigmatic_code_creation_effect: "Grants an opportunity to study §Y$tech_enigmatic_encoder$§! and §Y$tech_enigmatic_decoder$§!."
 sic_mod.171.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.171.desc: "Our Encryption has been significantly improved with the sudden advancement of technology.\nThis is still not enough.\nWe will need to develop a cipher system that can be widely applied in space combat to ensure that we are able to fight it without backlash. The process will require incredible scientific capacity, of course."
 sic_mod.172.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.172.desc: "It is done. We have invented a cipher system that the Galactic Ones cannot comprehend, and in the process, our own ability to decipher is greatly improved. Now, the final step we will have to make is to make the more complex devices that will house the system, which will then be applied on board our ships."
 sic_mod.173.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.173.desc: "This cipher system, which we are currently working on, bears... an astounding similarity to the one we recently discovered. It seems we have no need to spend more time on it."
 tech_rebirth_from_the_church: "Rise Again"
 tech_rebirth_from_the_church_desc: "We will search for a way to survive the Great Collapse - and maybe, of course, it will bring some windfall."
 tech_rebirth_from_the_church_effect: "A chance to study the §Y$tech_dragon_armor$§!."
 sic_mod.174.name: "$tech_rebirth_from_the_church$"
 sic_mod.174.desc: "Ever since we took to the stars, our scientists have been asking questions: Do we have a way to live off the inevitable 'Grand Collapse' of the universe? And now, by setting up a sophisticated model to personally deduce the seemingly impossible. The process requires an incredibly large scientific capacity, of course."
 sic_mod.175.name: "$tech_rebirth_from_the_church$"
 sic_mod.175.desc: "After a lengthy study, our scientists were surprised to discover that birthing from the Grand Collapse would be quite possible. They have now constructed a beautiful biological model and confirmed its ability to survive to the next universe. While it is still far away for us, we have unexpectedly acquired a new armor structure that can obviously be used in warfare."
 sic_mod.176.name: "$tech_enigmatic_code_creation$"
 sic_mod.176.desc: "What is embarrassing is that the way we've been searching for a way to live out the collapse seems to have been... found on the Ether Drake. It seems we have no need to spend any more time on this."
 sic_mod.180.name: "Crystal Plating Study"
 sic_mod.180.desc: "After discovering the rare crystals, our scientists were looking for a way to directly use them to boost our hull, but to no avail. Only recently, after we completely changed our scientific thinking, did we find a way to install them in the hull tissue."
 sic_mod.181.name: "Crystal Plating Study"
 sic_mod.181.desc: "Our scientists have studied the crystal-infused plating in great detail, and it has been found that it could be further improved. If we use special means to directly add rare crystals (instead of simply adding crystals when forged) to the forging process of alloys, the resulting hull tissue can withstand more damage."
 sic_mod.182.name: "Nanite Repair System"
 sic_mod.182.desc: "Following a recent attempt by our science team to combine the reconstructed hulls with the nanorobots technology, a prototype of a "nanite restoration system" has been designed. The mass-production of this system will require more research, but initial tests have shown it to be much more efficient than traditional silicon-based bacterian hull regenerative technology."
