 emperor.2.intro.desc:0 "It is the dawn of a New Order. The old Galactic Community has been dismantled, and in its place the §H[Root.GetGalEmpireName]§! has risen. After claiming our unquestionable authority over this new pan galactic state, we are now known as the §H[Root.GetName]§!."
 emperor.2.d.desc:0 "In a lavish coronation ceremony broadcast across the entire galaxy, [Root.Capital.GetName] has been crowned Emperor of the new empire on [ruler.GetRegnalName] - although he still holds the office of [Root.GetRulerTitle], the first Imperial Edict that followed provided for the continued political order of the [Root.GetName]. A new Galactic Imperium has been formed in galactic sway of debate."

 emperor.2.lecture.desc:1 "Fellows, we know what we strive for." He looked around, and looked to the cameras from all around - and all who were behind the screen, saying, "Improbably, the Kaiser is merely a means to appease the galaxy.

 emperor.3.d.desc:0 "In a galactic-wide coronation ceremony, in [gal_emperor.Capital.GetName], [gal_emperor.ruler.GetRegnalName] rejected the demand to be crowned, and after giving a speech on political views concerning the rights of the people of the [Root.GetGalEmpireName], announced that [gal_emperor.ruler.GetName]'s administration still held."

 emperor.52.communism.desc:1 "All references to the old Galactic Community have been swept away in the new Imperium, and as part of this reorganization, the Galactic Defense Force has changed its name to the §HImperial Armada§!.\n\nThis new fleet will inherit most of the rank structure and organization of the GDF, but new uniforms and insignia will be replaced with all military personnel required to swear battles for the defense of the entire galaxy.\n\nThe crews and support personnel of the fleet will still be recruited from all members of the Imperium, while a elite contingent of commissars will be brought up from the [gal_emperor.GetSpeciesNamePlural] and other sapient beings who are the strongest in the communism."

 emperor.72.communism.desc:0 "With the rise of the Imperium, GALPOL is being reorganized, changing its name to the §HImperial Security Directorate§! (or People's Anti-Counter Commissariat). The ISD agents are still able to extend their activities across the Imperium and report back to the [gal_emperor.GetRulerTitle] directly through the Imperial Ministry of Justice.\n\nThe ISD will still support local law enforcement agencies in their fights, while also investigating and punishments for serious crimes related to splinter states or the corruption of the state.\n\nAlthough all members have vowed on entry to protect fundamental interests of working people from subversive elements, elements of the population worry that the former police organization may turn into a tool of oppression..."

The civilization of the [gal_emperor.GetSpeciesNamePlural] was once shattered, the history and glory of their past shattered, and despised until now upon our rise once more. Now, as our nation once again dominates the galaxy, more and more citizens have started to choose to part with the indignity of the past and usher in a new future.
