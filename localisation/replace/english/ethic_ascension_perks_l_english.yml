# Utopia Events
 utopia.2551G.desc:0 "At last. The flesh cages that imprisoned us have been purged, and the neural patterns of our individuals have all been uploaded into new synthetic units. Disease, aging and all the other wellsprings of misery associated with an organic existence are now a thing of the past. The great sea of consciousness still exists here - From psionic waves to quantum frequencies, it is still everywhere. \n\nSince we have shed our former organic identity, it is only appropriate that we come up with a new name for our improved synthetic forms."
 utopia.2600G.desc:0 "Since the beginning of our civilization, the great sea of consciousness has connected the hearts of every [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural]. Our scientists have made a lot of hypotheses and empirical evidences for this extraordinary power named "Psychic Energy."\n\nNow, scientists have finally obtained conclusive evidence to prove that [Root.GetSpeciesName] has potential psionic potential, and have observed an increase in the number of individuals capable of this extraordinary ability.\n\nIs this because of some kind of instantaneous growth blowout, or is it because the development of our sea of consciousness has stimulated psionic potential? We don't know."
 utopia.2650G.desc:0 "The [Root.GetSpeciesName] species has experienced what can only be described as a Great Awakening. For a time now, we have been aware of the great psionic potential inherent in our species, but such powers have only manifested themselves in a small minority... until now.\n\nAlmost overnight, [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] everywhere have unlocked their full psionic capacity. Our sea of consciousness is completely open to us, collectively activating the psionic potential in our brains.\n\nIn an instant, all of us felt a certain "feeling of the shackles disappearing", but it quickly made a comeback, incorporating our consciousness into it. Many [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] began to resist the invasion of this huge will in an instant, and their efforts——"
 utopia.2650.b:0 "Let us wake up from slavery and gain freedom and rebirth."
 utopia.2650.c:0 "In vain, the great sea of consciousness extends beyond eternity."

They advocate self-management with their low-efficiency personalities, and claim that this can truly enable the future society to come true.\n\nNow, the central processing unit is making a judgment, is it to abandon these intellectual lives and let them "build communism" on a higher level? Or stick to the existing path and prosper with the personality? or......"
