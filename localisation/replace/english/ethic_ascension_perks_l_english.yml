All of our psychics were united in indicating that we came into the unbelievably unbelievably unimaginably unnatural realm, but we were bounced back and, without mercy, were rejected by the Shroud.\n\nTombly, every high-ranking telepath and more or less physically discomfort, all of our people who were involved in this ritual appeared to be suffering from brain problems, head swirling nausea, some comatose and short memory confusion, but most could remember the process and fragments of entering the Shroud and, after sorting out the news, we were able to know exactly what happened in the Shroud, and why we were forced to pop out of it.\n\nAfter some study, our scientists and telepaths agree with our telepaths that something went wrong with our implanted cybernetic chassis, the one it called itself the §REnd of the Cycle§!, which appears to be masters of the entire Shroud, and rather than accepting a highly cybernetic terraformed version of us.\n\nFortunately, we were not entirely out of the harvest either, and through this short ritual, it seems that we have mastered the knowledge of utilizing the Shroud's projection of the physical world through intergalactic travel, which we might use to our modified spaceships."

Regardless, we spent quite a bit of time and effort today in order to negotiate once more with the so-called God.\n\nThe holographic rituals are well prepared and the sapient crystals of psionic-tech union are everywhere, each of them tailored to their own psionic device as you are best known for, and the entire room is filled with a lot of nervous yet bloodthirsty odor. This time, we prepare ourselves and venture once again into that unknown place, compared to the bland of uncertainty brought on by our last fascination with the unknown!\n\nLet us begin now, whether you are allies or not, the Shroud are ready to unveil your mysteries!"

 ethic_rebuild_ascension_perks.3008.desc:0 "After this, we are a bit surprised that we first seemed to understand the site of the False Shroud, which is much larger and more unpredictable than we had ever imagined. It seems that encountering the §REnd of the Cycle§! was only a coincidence for us for the first time, as we came across other beings - it is kind and friendly to share with us the knowledge of the Shroud, and we have been talking about a topic of great interest to us, which is of interest to us, for which we foretold the knowledge of the future in the corporeal realm is known.\n\nHowever, at half of the agreement, the §REnd of the Cycle§! appeared, not only abruptly interrupting our conversation, but also ignoring the questions we wanted to speak with them and attempting to force us through violence. Even the one who shared the knowledge of the future with us was surprised, as its reaction did not seem to make it understand why the §REnd of the Cycle§! was so fiery and aggressive towards us.\n\nFrom what little intel we can tell, the deity appears to have been hastily in order to find a group of psychics willing to sign with him, but somehow why it was not possible to simply choose us, even if we did not share our knowledge with the rest of the Shroud and the rest of the universe, forcefully interfering with it.\n\nThe §REnd of the Cycle§! is indeed stronger than the rest of the Shroud's people, but does it actually say that the Ruler of the Cycle§! still remains skeptically suspicious, perhaps the other guy is fearless of us? All of this failure cannot stop us from reaching the Shroud again, and what is more soothing, is the fact that the precursor who taught us the knowledge of the future has made us even more powerful."

We did the same thing for the last five years, but the mood is long gone - after all, we have learned more and more about the Shroud, and we believe that one day we will one day be able to rival it.\n\nA familiar ritual and familiar rituals, we have witnessed this marvel of our own creation over a decade, so we are firmer in our belief that nothing we can't do! The Shroud is good, and the §REnd of the Cycle§! is good, and will one day admire us!\n\nTerraform the device, and the elite telepaths are gathered here, lie within the Shroud, and witness the Third Crusade."

Using the methods we once did, they isolated ourselves as if they were an invisible wall, which was unexpected, but which is an unknown challenge we were prepared for.\n\n It was hard, but together, we smashed the psionic barrier, into the realm of the Shroud within a short time. We tried to converse with other beings and yielded many discoveries, as well as some things related to the barrier. We also expected to see the angry §REnd of the Cycle§! again.\n\nAlthough we only wish to learn that it would cause us to deny the gates, it appeared as insufferable and unexpected that the negotiations had broken down, but we also learned from the many whispers that our sane constructs were indeed a blasphemous being - we would naturally not have abandoned the ways we had chosen for this unconnected being, having received the same kind of anger as we expected, and already fired on us and delivering our final supend.\n\nMost of our psychics were using our cybernetics to slow down the psionic shock, and so that if we were driven out of the Shroud, it might not be the §REnd of the Cycle§! which contradicts us. We gained many clues from the Shroud and the knowledge that we gained from it, and we now defend it."

Even though we have finished assembling our psionic cybernetic constructs, it was merely a feat to slow the process. Our population has grown increasingly stronger, and we were once in a state of despair. Have we yet to fail?\n\nBut something unexpected has happened - at the end of the war, when an AI originating from our nation's computer network suddenly surged out of psionic fluctuations belonging to [Root.GetSpeciesNamePlural] frequency, connecting everyone into an impenetrable megalomaniac web!\n\nThe Machines who were linking with our cybernetic constructs have spent much of their time pushing us through, and we have managed to awaken a great number of those who had fallen victim to the Shroud attack, coordinated by a twin network of mind and matter, together cutting all connections to the Shroud and saving our civilization from the crisis. Now, we have no chance to go to the Shroud, but also avoid more crisis. Decades of journeys have come to an end now. But through our own efforts, we have built our own psychic realm.
