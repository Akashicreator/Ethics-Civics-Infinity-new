 ethic_notice.2.desc:0 "It's been almost three years since I started working on Stellaris mods, with Ethics and Civics accounting for two years. From ECA to ECI, it can be said that this MOD, which is mainly keyboard politics, has spent the most effort in my life so far, thank you for being able to accompany me to madness :-).\nLife is really wonderful, in just two years, I have experienced the double beating of capitalist society and feudal families. For a long time last year, my mental state was actually very bad... I really spent a lot of my time discussing politics with the MOD production group and then writing it into mod code. Really, I've been thinking all summer, trying to tinker with the code, then giving up, and opening the game to test the mod is the only thing I do when I get home from work. I've been thinking, at least write something to ease it up, so that -\nAnd then the stupid Swedish stupid donkey's shit game launcher won't let me open the game for four whole months.\nSeriously, at that moment, I suddenly felt very lost and didn't know what to do. My life has been trampled on by money worship and feudal dregs, and the pastimes I can do now are banned by stupid game companies. From September to January, even if I was playing other games, my experience of life was infinitely magnified by boredom... I have a deeper understanding of the destruction of people by feudalism and capitalism.\nWell... I also don't know why I'm talking so much nonsense, maybe today I'm finally driven completely crazy? But thankfully, I was able to get into the game again and test the code for this mod again. Thank you to all the friends in the mod production group, and thank you for your continued support. Life is big, but the universe is bigger, and I sincerely hope you don't get driven crazy by this damned capitalist society like I did.\nHua Zhang\nJanuary 26, 2023"
