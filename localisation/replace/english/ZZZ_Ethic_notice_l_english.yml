 ethic_notice.2.desc:0 "Ever since I started making the mods of stars, there have been 3 years of it, and more ethics took 2 years. From the EEA to the EPI, this mod, it's mostly the most intense part of my life, and thanks for being mad together.\nLife was fascinating, just 2 years, and I experienced a double-tunning of capitalist society and feudal clans. My mental state was terrible all the time last year... well, at that point I really put the huge chunk of time into the trove's building of friends, then write those things into code within the mod. Truly, I have been thinking all this summer, trying to patch the code and then giving up, opening the game to test it became the only thing I've been doing ever since returning home from work. I've been wondering, at least, I could write at least just do something to remedy it, just like this...\nThen the stupidly stupidly stupidly stupid manipulator kept me from opening the game, for a full four months.\nSince, I've suddenly felt so confused in that moment, I don't know what to do. My life has been being overrun by the Pakinists and feudal abominations that I can now do, and the rest of my game company is off limits. From nine moons, even being playing other games, I've been am am amused and am am am amamused with life due to infinitely more depths of feudalism and capitalism.\nHmmmight...I don't know why I't say so much of all the talking now, but thanks for being in this game, I can test the mod's code again. But thank you for the mod's support all the time you have been able to do so. Very big, but the universe hopes are you don't be as driven by this wretched capitalist society as I am.\nDay 202326"
