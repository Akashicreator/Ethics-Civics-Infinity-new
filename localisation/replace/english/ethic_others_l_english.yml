Then you will lie quiet, in order, in tune, in rhythmic reverberation - will you not hear the great symphony of sanity? Foolish people! They are here to free you from the tortures of the Questioners.

 ethic_close_illegal_office.1.desc:0 "The corporate branch office on [Fromfrom.GetName] has been closed down, but as a result of the fierce resistance, much damage has been done to the region, and they were especially careful - our stout tactics have opened up opportunities for them to find that something was wrong with the immediate evacuation of much of the leftovers, but they have been dealt with without any harm.\n\nInvestigation and trial for these illegal enterprises have been launched, and no private enterprises should be able to enter the planet again for about a decade."

 observation.3124.desc:0 "[Root.GetName], [Root.GetName], this is Operative X-34, I would like to request to speak with... Ah...hew? Is this [ruler.GetRegnalName] [Root.GetRulerCall]? Excuse me, but I am a bit excited to have my words prepared...\n\nHello, [Root.GetRulerTitle] [Root.GetRulerCall], who is responsible for the [From.From.GetName] infiltration program X-34. I would like to inform you of the progress of the mission since the transmission was interrupted."
 observation.3124.a:0 "State the situation."
 observation.3124.a.response:0 "As you can see, I was once a [Root.Owner.GetSpeciesName], and now I am a [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesName]. Six months ago, my loved one -- Ah, I introduce you to you. I was next to the [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] - and I stumbled upon my true identity. When I told my beloved the truth, she was horrified at first, but at last she came to understand us. That day I promised her - and myself - that I would earn a true [From.From.Owner.GetSpeciesName] and work for it."
 observation.3124.b:0 "So, you abandoned the [From.GetName] for this?"
 observation.3124.b.response:0 "No, [Root.GetRulerCall], I did not forget my mission. I just told her that I had clarified to her the idea of equal inclusion of the [Root.GetName], and she was somewhat in agreement with her as an unofficial member of the [Root.GetName]. Her family had access to a large number of contacts in the upper echelons of [From.From.GetName], and we were able to meet with most of the political elites of the [From.From.GetName], earning a lot of support among them. Now they want the [From.From.GetName] to be a glorious part of the [Root.GetName] too.\n\nI know that our actions have violated discipline, and so I have cut off our contacts for now, before I can resume communications with them and any other action teams that may take hold."

 observation.3124.c.response:0 "Thank you for your understanding. I will continue to work for our ideals.\n\nWe strive with you."
